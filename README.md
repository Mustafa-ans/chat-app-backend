This repo has all the APIs that I made using the python library Flask 
In order to see the functioning of the APIs you will need to install and customize the postman application to interact with them, there are multiple HTTP requests that you can send using postman and get the response 
I have added the screenshots of the same in the repo of the interface of the postman
